Problem Set 1
-------------

1.  Let Bt be standard Brownian motion and f(x) = x3+ex. Compute df(Bt) using the formalism of Ito's formula.
2.  Work out an explicit example (as small as you like) of the Cori-Vaquelin-Schaeer, the Mullin bijection, the hamburger cheeseburger bijection, and the bipolar planar map bijection.
3.  Generate a uniform random spanning tree on a small graph (by hand) using coin tosses and Wilson's algorithm.
4.  If you have the range of a stable subordinator of parameter α and the range of another stable subordinator of parameter β, what conditions on β and α ensure the intersection of these two sets is almost surely empty? Use the Bessel process relationship to explain your answer.
5.  Read and take notes on Berestycki's ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[Introduction to the Gaussian Free Field and Liouville Quantum Gravity (PDF - 2.8MB)](http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~bishop/classes/math638.F20/Berestycki_GFF_LQG.pdf). (You may also consult [Gaussian free fields for mathematicians](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312099) and the introduction to [Liouville quantum gravity and KPZ](http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1560).) Try working through some of the exercises.
6.  Come talk to me at some point about open problems and / or your final project.

Problem Set 2
-------------

1.  Read and take notes on ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[Schramm-Loewner Evolution (PDF)](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~james/Lectures/sle.pdf) by Berestycki and Norris. (You may also consult the notes by Lawler, by Kager / Neinhuis, and by Werner in the [readings section]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings).) Try working out a few of the things left as exercises.
2.  Read and take notes on one of the references (your choice) from the Selected References on Universal Object Relationships portion in the [readings section]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings).
3.  Read and take notes on one of the papers (your choice) about growth models in the [readings section]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings).
4.  Come talk to me at some point about open problems and / or your final project.

Final Project
-------------

The final project may be either expository or original-research based. Several research problems are suggested in the [Open Problems (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_177f15_openp) document. Collaborative efforts will be allowed. The final project is due on last day of class.
